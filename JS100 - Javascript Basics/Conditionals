1. Truthy vs Falsy

Without looking at your notes or MDN, try to recall all values that count as falsy in JavaScript.

In JavaScript, there are only eight values that are falsy. They are:

false
null
undefined
0
NaN
'' or ""
-0 (negative zero)
0n (BigInt zero)

2. Yes? No? Part 1

The code provided below will randomly initialize randomNumber to either 0 or 1 each time it is executed.

Write an if statement that logs 'Yes!' if randomNumber is 1, and 'No.' if randomNumber is 0.

let randomNumber = Math.round(Math.random());

if (randomNumber) {
  console.log('Yes!');
} else {
  console.log('No');
}

3. Yes? No? Part 2 (ternary operator)

Take your code from the previous exercise and rewrite the conditional so that it uses the ternary if-then-else operator.

let randomNumber = Math.round(Math.random());

console.log(randomNumber ? 'Yes!' : 'No.');

4. Check the Weather, Part 1

Initialize a variable weather with a string value being "sunny", "rainy", or anything else.

Write an if statement that logs:

"It's a beautiful day!" if weather is assigned to the string "sunny",
"Grab your umbrella." if weather is assigned to the string "rainy", and
"Let's stay inside." otherwise.
Test your code with different values for weather.

let weather = 'snow storm'; // 'sunny', 'rainy', ...

if (weather === 'sunny') {
  console.log("It's a beautiful day!");
} else if (weather === 'rainy') {
  console.log('Grab your umbrella.');
} else {
  console.log("Let's stay inside.");
}

5. Switch 

Take a look at the code below. Without running it, determine what it will log to the console. If you're not sure, refer to the MDN documentation on switch statements.

6. Check the Weather, Part 2
Take your code from the previous Check the Weather exercise and rewrite it as a switch statement. Feel free to add more cases besides 'sunny' and 'rainy'.

switch (weather) {
  case 'sunny':
    console.log("It's a beautiful day!");
    break;
  case 'rainy':
    console.log('Grab your umbrella.');
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Let's stay inside.");
}
