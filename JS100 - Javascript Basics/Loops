1. Loop and Log

Add some code inside of the for loop below that logs the current value of i to the console on each iteration. Before you run the code: What sequence of numbers do you expect to be logged?

for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i += 2) {
  console.log(i);
}

This code logs:
0
2
4
6
8
10

2. Countdown

The code below logs the numbers from 1 to 10. Change it, so that it instead logs the numbers from 10 to 1 in decreasing order, and then logs 'Launch!'.

for (let i = 10; i > 0; i -= 1) {
  console.log(i);
}
console.log('Launch!');

3. Triple Greeting

Write a loop that logs greeting three times.

let greeting = 'Aloha!';

for (let count = 1; count <= 3; count += 1) {
  console.log(greeting);
}

4. Take Two

Write a for loop that iterates over all numbers from 1 to 100, and outputs the result of multiplying each element by 2.

for (let num = 1; num <= 100; num += 1) {
  console.log(num * 2);
}

5. Looping over Array Elements

Using the code below as a starting point, write a while loop that logs the elements of array at each index, and terminates after logging the last element of the array.

let array = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let index = 0;

while (index < array.length) {
  console.log(array[index]);
  index += 1;
}

6. Continue

Take a moment to read the MDN documentation on the continue statement.

Then write a for loop that loops over the elements of the array cities and logs the length of each string to the console. If the element is null, skip forward to the next iteration without logging anything to the console.

let cities = ['Istanbul', 'Los Angeles', 'Tokyo', null, 'Vienna', null, 'London', 'Beijing', null];

for (let i = 0; i < cities.length; i += 1) {
  if (cities[i] === null) {
    continue;
  }

  console.log(cities[i].length);
}

7. And on and on and on

The following code keeps looping forever. (You can hit Ctrl-C to stop it.) Why is that? Also modify it so that it stops after the first iteration.

for (let i = 0; ; i += 1) {
  console.log("and on");
  break;
}

8. That's Odd

Write a while loop that logs all odd natural numbers between 1 and 40.

let num = 1;

while (num < 40) {
  console.log(num);
  num += 2;
}

9. Finding Nemo

Loop over the elements of the array fish, logging each one. Terminate the loop immediately after logging the string 'Nemo'.

let fish = ['Dory', 'Marlin', 'Gill', 'Nemo', 'Bruce'];

for (let i = 0; i < fish.length; i += 1) {
  console.log(fish[i]);

  if (fish[i] === 'Nemo') {
    break;
  }
}

10. Do...While

What is the difference between the following two code snippets? Check the MDN documentation on while and do...while.

Both statements execute the given block as long as the condition evaluates to true. The difference is that the condition in a while statement is checked before executing the block, while the condition in a do...while statement is checked after the block has been executed. So the block in a do...while statement will always be executed at least once, even if the condition is not satisfied.

Therefore the second code snippet logs 'Woooot!' once, while the first code snippet does not log anything.
