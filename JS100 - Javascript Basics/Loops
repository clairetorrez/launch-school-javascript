Loop and Log

1. Add some code inside of the for loop below that logs the current value of i to the console on each iteration. Before you run the code: What sequence of numbers do you expect to be logged?

for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i += 2) {
  console.log(i);
}

This code logs:
0
2
4
6
8
10

Countdown

2. The code below logs the numbers from 1 to 10. Change it, so that it instead logs the numbers from 10 to 1 in decreasing order, and then logs 'Launch!'.

for (let i = 10; i > 0; i -= 1) {
  console.log(i);
}
console.log('Launch!');
